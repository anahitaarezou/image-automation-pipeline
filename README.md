# Image Automation Pipeline

A Python-based automation tool for **bulk image processing**.

This project is designed for scenarios where handling images manually
is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

---

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

In content-heavy systems (e-commerce, catalogs, datasets), images often require:
- Renaming
- Resizing
- Format conversion
- Background removal
- Optimization for upload

Doing this manually does not scale.

This tool automates the entire pipeline.

## 🚀 Features

- Batch image processing
- Configurable resize and format conversion
- Automated renaming logic
- Optional background removal
- Output ready for upload or further processing

Built to handle **large volumes**, not just demos.
