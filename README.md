# Image Automation Pipeline

A Python-based automation tool for **bulk image processing**.

This project is designed for scenarios where handling images manually
is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

---

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

In content-heavy systems (e-commerce, catalogs, datasets), images often require:
- Renaming
- Resizing
- Format conversion
- Background removal
- Optimization for upload

Doing this manually does not scale.

This tool automates the entire pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Batch image processing
- Configurable resize and format conversion
- Automated renaming logic
- Optional background removal
- Output ready for upload or further processing

Built to handle **large volumes**, not just demos.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pillow (PIL)
- File system automation
- Modular script design

## ⚙️ How It Works (High-Level)

1. Reads images from input directory
2. Applies defined transformations
3. Handles edge cases (invalid files, formats)
4. Saves processed images in a clean, structured output

The logic is modular and reusable.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Preparing product images for e-commerce upload
- Cleaning datasets for ML / AI pipelines
- Bulk content migration
- Image normalization across large libraries

---

## 🔒 Notes

- Sample images only
- No client data included
- Designed as a reusable automation pattern

---

## 📌 Status

This project is actively expandable.
Future additions may include:
- CLI interface
- Config-based workflows
- Cloud storage support
- Parallel processing
